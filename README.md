# BungeeCloud

This is a simple system which allows you to Minecraft launch servers dynamically on other host instances and to control them from your BungeeCord proxy. It consists of a Spigot plugin, a BungeeCord plugin and a Java program you have to launch on every machine you want to host servers on.

The project is inactive at the moment.
